# Technical Solutions for Key Challenges

For my AI recruitment system, I'd like detailed solutions to these specific technical challenges:

## 1. Optimizing Ollama Performance

Provide specific code examples for:
- How to optimize model loading and inference with Ollama
- Techniques for caching and reusing model instances
- Parallel processing strategies for handling multiple candidate evaluations
- Recommended configuration settings for each agent based on their specific needs

## 2. Accurate Resume Parsing

Show me how to:
- Extract structured information from unstructured CV text
- Handle different CV formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Normalize extracted information (skills, job titles, education)
- Deal with ambiguities and missing information
- Implement custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) to identify skills, experiences, etc.

## 3. Sophisticated Matching Algorithm

Provide detailed implementation for:
- A weighted scoring system that prioritizes different criteria based on job type
- Handling of equivalent skills (e.g., recognizing that "React.js" and "ReactJS" are the same)
- Consideration of experience quality (not just years but relevance)
- Detection of career progression and growth potential
- Handling of edge cases (career changers, unconventional backgrounds)

## 4. Multi-Agent Coordination

Detail the mechanisms for:
- Message passing between agents
- Handling dependencies between agent tasks
- Error recovery and fallback strategies
- Maintaining coherent state across the agent system
- Monitoring and logging agent interactions for debugging

## 5. Performance Optimization

Provide strategies for:
- Handling large volumes of CVs efficiently
- Minimizing database read/write operations
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Batch processing for improved throughput
- Resource allocation between different agents

I'd like to see concrete code examples, not just general approaches. Please include implementation details that address these challenges specifically within the context of my AI recruitment system.
